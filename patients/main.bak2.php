				<div class="explan">
					<p>
						Regdanvimab was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates, of which it showed the highest potency in neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Regdanvimab blocks SARS-CoV-2 from binding to the ACE2 receptor and therefore prevents the virus from entering into human cells.
