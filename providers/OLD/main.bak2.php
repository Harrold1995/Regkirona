				<p>
					Reganvimab is an investigational medicine used to treat mild to moderate symptoms in non-hospitalized adults and who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms or the need for hospitalization.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regdanvimab was developed as a candidate treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates and selecting those that showed the highest potency in neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus including the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant).
				</p>
				<p>
					In pre-clinical data the treatment candidate demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in viral 
					load of SARS-CoV-2, as well as a reduction in lung inflammation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Results from the global Phase I clinical trial of regdanvimab demonstrated promising safety, tolerability, antiviral effect and efficacy profile in providers with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
