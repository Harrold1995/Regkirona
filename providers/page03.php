      *IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Infusion sites displayed in this tool have
      been authorized to administer antibody treatments for COVID-positive
      providers under Emergency Use Authorization. These antibody
      therapies are restricted to certain high-risk providers and require
      a drug order (similar to a prescription) from a Health Care Provider
      (HCP) for eligible providers. HCPs must verify eligibility of their
      providers and verify the availability of doses at an authorized
      infusion site before they refer an eligible patient to schedule an
      appointment to receive treatment at an authorized infusion site.
